# Biography

Xiaoran Xu is a researcher at Hulu (Beijing Office). He is a member of the Hulu Innovation Lab, working in the Recommendation Research team. His research work focuses on recommendation reasoning, using differentiable reasoning and stochastic reasoning approaches to discover latent causal connections and bring better interpretability for recommendation systems. He is also interested in combining deep learning, reinforcement learning and knowledge graph-based logic programming to explore for the next-generation AI.

Recently, he developed a generalized backpropagation framework - Backprop-Q, making complex stochastic systems systematically trainable in an end-to-end style. He also proposed a novel flow-based attention mechanism - attention flow, to effectively address reasoning tasks on graph-structured data.
