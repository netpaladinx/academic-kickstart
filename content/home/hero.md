<p class="hero-lead" style="font-size: 0.9rem"><em>When I heard the learn’d astronomer,
<br>When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,
<br>When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,
<br>When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,
<br>How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
<br>Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,
<br>In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
<br>Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.</em></p>
